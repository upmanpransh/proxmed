        "heading": "What Are Cashback Bonuses?",
        "data": "A cashback bonus is a casino promotion that allows players to recoup a portion of their net losses over a specific period or across selected games. It's designed to soften the blow of losing streaks and reward players for continued engagement, acting as both a loyalty incentive and a retention tool for online casinos. For example, if you activate a 20% cashback bonus and lose €100, the casino will refund €20 back to your account—usually after the wagering criteria are met."

        "heading": "🎯 Types of Cashback Bonuses",
        "data": "Cashback bonuses come in several formats, each catering to different gaming preferences and loss types. Here's a breakdown:\n✅ 1. Cashback on All Losses: You receive a percentage of your total net losses across all games. This type is rare and generous, typically offered during special promotions.\n✅ 2. Losing Bets or Spins: Covers a percentage of your losing bets or spins only—not total net losses. These are usually tracked over a defined promotional period.\n✅ 3. Cashback on Deposits: Rather than basing cashback on losses, the casino gives back a percentage of your deposit amount, even if you win. For example, 20% cashback on a €100 deposit returns €20, regardless of outcomes.\n✅ 4. Daily Cashback Bonus: The most common type. You'll get a daily refund on net losses, giving you some funds to continue playing without making a fresh deposit.\n✅ 5. Weekly Cashback Bonus: Covers seven-day periods. After meeting wagering requirements, the casino refunds a percentage of your net losses at week's end.\n✅ 6. Monthly Cashback Bonus: Calculates losses over an entire month. This bonus typically yields higher amounts and is great for regular players who may not track their losses daily.\n✅ 7. VIP Cashback: Exclusive to VIP or loyalty program members, these cashback percentages can climb as high as 50% based on your VIP tier. VIP cashback often comes with fewer conditions and higher payout caps.\n✅ 8. Wager-Free Cashback: You receive your cashback with no playthrough requirement. Although attractive, this bonus may have a minimum loss threshold you must reach before claiming it."
