        "heading": "Are Free Spins the Same As Bonus Spins?",
        "data": "You might have come across offers dubbed as 'Bonus Spins' or 'Extra Spins' instead of Free Spins. In essence, there is no difference between these terms, and they all work exactly the same. The reason why some of the new casinos use this wording is to make sure they are compliant with gambling regulations and the terms of their licence. Truth be told, Bonus Spins and Extra Spins are still Free Spins; it's just that gambling sites want to reassure their respective regulators they are not luring players with false advertisement."
