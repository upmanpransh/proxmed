They give players the opportunity to win real money — one of the main attractions of the experience.\nWhile most games rely on chance, several (especially table and card games) involve a degree of skill. Each game has its own set of strategies that players can learn to increase their chances of success. From social interaction in land-based venues to the vast selection of online games, the entertainment factor remains constant."

        "data": "All casino games work in favour of the \"house\" in the long run, providing casinos a statistical edge. However, players can still win over short-term sessions.\nThere are three broad categories of casino games:\n● Gaming machines: Like slots or pachinko, relying solely on chance.\n● Table games: Like blackjack and poker, blending skill and luck.\n● Random number games: Based entirely on RNGs (Random Number Generators), such as keno or lotteries.\nFor example, roulette is a hybrid: it involves both random numbers and social skill, offering a classic experience."
