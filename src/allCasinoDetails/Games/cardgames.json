        "data": "Card games are among the most popular gambling choices at online and land-based casinos. Whether you enjoy classic Blackjack, sophisticated Poker, or fast-paced Three-Card variants, all card games share a fundamental principle: each player can see only their own hand, and every card's identity is hidden from others — making strategy, bluffing, and luck central elements. Cards are uniform in size and appearance on the back, and the deck's composition is known to all. However, once the cards are dealt, the strategic mystery begins."
