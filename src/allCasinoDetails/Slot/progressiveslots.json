        "heading": "How Do Progressive Jackpots Work?",
        "data": "Progressive jackpots accumulate based on a small percentage of each bet placed by players. The jackpot continues to grow until one lucky player lands the jackpot-winning combination, triggering the top prize.\nThere are three types of progressive jackpots:\n1. Standalone Progressives\nThese are tied to a single game on a single machine or site. The jackpot grows only from that one game.\n2. Local Progressives\nThese connect multiple machines within the same casino or brand. The jackpot grows faster and tends to be larger than standalone progressives.\n3. Networked (Wide-Area) Progressives\nThese are linked across many casinos and platforms. This is how jackpots reach multi-million dollar values. Examples include Mega Moolah and Mega Fortune."
