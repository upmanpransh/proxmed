      "data": "A free bet is a promotional offer from a sportsbook that allows you to place a wager without using your own money. Free bets are often awarded as part of a welcome package, loyalty reward, or specific promotion and are used to attract new users or reward existing ones.\nWhile the term free sounds straightforward, not all free bets are created equal. They come with different terms, expiry dates, minimum odds, and wagering requirements that affect how you use them and whether you can withdraw any winnings."

      "heading": "How Free Bets Work",
      "data": "Unlike regular bets, where you use your own deposited funds, free bets are placed using money provided by the sportsbook. This means you’re not risking your own balance, but you must still follow a set of rules to use the offer correctly and potentially convert it into real money.\nKey Terms You Should Know\n● Minimum odds: Most free bets require you to place your wager on odds above a specific threshold (e.g. 1.5 or 2.0).\n● Expiry date: Free bets typically expire within 3 to 30 days.\n● Bet type or event restrictions: Some offers are limited to certain markets or events (e.g. Champions League games).\n● Stake not returned (SNR): When your free bet wins, you only get the profit—not the stake.\n● Wagering requirements: Sometimes, you must bet your winnings several times before withdrawal is allowed."

      "data": "1. Matched Free Bet\nWhen you place a qualifying bet (usually on a specific market or event), the sportsbook rewards you with a free bet of the same value. For example:\n“Bet £10 on Tuesday and get a £10 free bet on Wednesday.”\n2. Matched Deposit Bonus\nHere, the bookmaker matches your deposit (e.g., 100% match up to £50), giving you extra funds to bet with. This type of bonus often comes with lower restrictions than fixed-stake free bets.\n3. No Deposit Free Bets\nThese are the most attractive offers, especially for new users. No need to deposit—just register and receive a free bet. These usually have higher wagering requirements and lower withdrawal limits but offer true \"free play\" opportunities.\n4. Enhanced Odds Bonus\nBoosted odds promos increase your potential winnings on select bets. While not technically free bets, they often come with similar terms, such as max stake limits and winnings paid in free bet credits.\n5. Stake Not Returned Bets (SNR)\nIf you win using your free bet, the stake is not included in your returns. Example:\nFree Bet: £10 at 2.0 odds → Return = £10 profit (not £20)."
