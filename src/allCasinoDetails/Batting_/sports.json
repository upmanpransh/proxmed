Here's a quick rundown:\n➤ Straight Bet / Single Bet: Bet on the outcome of a single match or event (e.g., winner, draw).\n➤ System Bet: Combines multiple bets in a way that allows partial winnings even if not all selections are correct.\n➤ Parlay / Accumulator Bet: Bundles multiple bets into one. All must win for a payout, but the combined odds can lead to big rewards.\n➤ Moneyline: Betting on who wins — simple and widely used, especially in US sports.\n➤ Point Spread (Spread Betting): Bet on a team to win within a point margin — commonly used in basketball and football.\n➤ Totals (Over/Under): Bet whether the combined score will be over or under a line set by the sportsbook.\n➤ Teasers & Pleasers: Adjust point spreads for adjusted odds — teasers lower risk, pleasers increase payout potential."
