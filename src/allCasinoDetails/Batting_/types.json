Examples include:\n● A football team to win a match\n● A tennis player to win a set\n● A golfer to finish first in a tournament\nThis is the most basic and widely used betting type.\nAccumulator (Acca)\nAn accumulator combines multiple selections into a single bet. All selections must win for the bet to succeed.

For example, in a football match:\n● Team A to win\n● Both teams to score\n● Over 4.5 cards\nAll selections must be correct for the bet to win."
