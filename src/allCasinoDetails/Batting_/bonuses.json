      "data": "1. Welcome Bonuses\nWelcome bonuses are exclusive offers for new users who sign up and make their first deposit. Typically offered as:\n● Deposit Match Bonus – The sportsbook matches a percentage of your first deposit.\n● Free Bets – You get a free stake upon meeting specific conditions.\nAlways check for rollover requirements, bonus caps, and minimum deposits.\n2. Risk-Free Bets (Second Chance Bets)\nThese give you a safety net. If your first bet loses, the sportsbook refunds your stake in the form of bonus funds or a free bet. While advertised as risk-free, the first bet does involve real money, so it's more accurate to call it a second-chance opportunity.\n3. No Deposit Bonuses\nRare but valuable, these allow you to bet without depositing any money. Often offered as a sign-up incentive, no deposit bonuses are usually smaller and come with tighter terms such as high wagering requirements or low maximum withdrawal limits.\n4. Parlay Insurance\nIdeal for fans of multi-leg bets, parlay insurance returns your stake if one selection in your parlay loses. This bonus adds a layer of security and encourages bettors to keep playing accumulators even after a near-miss.\n5. Boosted Odds\nAlso called enhanced odds, this promotion raises the payout on specific bets—usually tied to major events. These boosted offers often have a maximum stake limit and might pay the enhanced portion in free bets.\n6. Reload Bonuses\nReload bonuses are recurring promotions for existing users. A typical reload bonus might be:\n● 25% bonus on deposits every weekend\n● 50% bonus on midweek deposits\nThey help loyal bettors get more value on their deposits regularly.\n7. Deposit Match Bonus\nSimilar to welcome bonuses but also used for existing players, deposit match bonuses reward you with additional funds based on the size of your deposit. For example:\n● 100% match up to €100 means a €100 deposit gives you €200 to play with.\nThese usually require a set number of wagers (playthroughs) before withdrawals are permitted."
